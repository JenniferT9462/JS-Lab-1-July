// [Chorus]
// Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
// Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
// Now the dark days are done and the bright days are here
// My Sunny one shines so sincere
// Sunny one so true, I love you

// [Verse 1]
// Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
// Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
// You gave to me your all and all
// And now I feel ten feet tall
// Sunny one so true, I love you

// [Verse 2]
// Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
// Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
// My life was torn like wind-blown sand
// Then a rock was formed when we held hands
// Sunny one so true, I love you

// [Verse 3]
// Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
// Mm, Sunny, thank you, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
// You're my spark of nature's fire
// You're my sweet, complete desire
// Sunny one so true, yes, I love you
// [Outro]
// I love you, I love you (Sunny)
// I love you (Sunny), said, I love you (Sunny)
// Yes, I love you (Sunny)
